# dj-stripe 2.10.0

**IMPORTANT**: Migrations have been reset. You MUST upgrade to dj-stripe 2.9.x before
upgrading to dj-stripe 2.10.x.

This release of dj-stripe continues the philosophy of becoming a more generalized
layer over the Stripe SDK.

In this version, we are removing many more database fields from the dj-stripe models,
replacing them by property accessors to `stripe_data` instead (or dropping support for
them altogether).

Why we are doing this: Supporting the Stripe data models manually has become impossible
due to the pace at which they are implementing new fields, changing old ones, or adding
new mechanisms. We are therefore planning to improve a tighter integration with the
Stripe SDK, and we are currently working on designing a more better model that allows
for storing and accessing Stripe objects in the database in a convenient, scalable way.

This release is meant to be a compatibility step towards that end goal. We previously
tried to work on a large 3.0 breaking change, but we now believe this to be too much of
a hassle for developers to deal with; we will therefore be stepping into it gradually,
which unfortunately means more breaking changes every release.

Where reasonable, we have added @property style accessors to the models. Which means
that most changes should be backwards-compatible if you are only directly accessing the
attributes on the models. What changes is how to filter the models, as the columns no
longer exist.
The `stripe_data` field that was added to all Stripe models continuously stores the full
Stripe model as it was last seen. This is a JSONField, and on our supported database
backends, it is possible to filter directly into it. For example, where you might have
done `Refund.objects.filter(receipt_number="XYZ")`, you may replace that with:
`Refund.objects.filter(stripe_data__receipt_number="XYZ")`.

We endeavour to keep the most important columns in each model. The ones that are dropped
are those that were part of our previous goal of having a 1:1 column mapping of Stripe
models, which is clearly no longer a reasonable goal.

## Version support

-   Support for Python versions older than 3.11 has been dropped.
-   Support for Django versions older than 5.0 has been dropped.
-   Migrations have been fully reset. You MUST upgrade to dj-stripe 2.9.x before
    upgrading to dj-stripe 2.10.x.

## Breaking Changes

-   Customer.subscribe() no longer takes its deprecated `plan` argument; use `price`.
-   Disputes no longer actively sync their linked files.

The following fields have been removed:

-   Customer: `coupon_end`, `coupon_start`, `legacy_cards`
-   Invoice: `plan`, `default_source`
-   Product: `attributes`, `caption`, `deactivate_on`, `images`, `package_dimensions`,
    `shippable`, `statement_descriptor`
-   PaymentIntent: All non-foreignkey fields have been removed
-   SetupIntent: All non-foreignkey fields have been removed

The following fields have been replaced by property accessors:

-   All Stripe models: `description`
-   Customer: `discount`
-   Discount: `invoice_item`
-   Dispute: `amount`, `balance_transactions`, `currency`, `evidence`,
    `evidence_details`, `is_charge_refundable`,, `reason`, `status`
-   Payout: `amount`, `arrival_date`, `automatic`, `failure_code`, `failure_message`,
    `method`, `source_type`, `statement_descriptor`, `status`, `type`
-   File: `filename`, `purpose`, `size`, `type`, `url`
-   FileLink: `expires_at`, `url`
-   Price: `billing_scheme`, `recurring`, `tiers`, `tiers_mode`, `transform_quantity`,
    `type`, `unit_amount`, `unit_amount_decimal`
-   Product: `default_price`, `type`
-   Refund: `failure`, `reason`, `receipt_number`, `status`

## Deprecations

-   `InvoiceOrLineItemForeignKey` is deprecated and will be removed next release.

## New features

-   New management command: `stripe_listen`. This command creates a temporary webhook
    endpoint and runs the stripe CLI `stripe listen` command to to forward incoming
    webhooks to it, allowing developers to listen to events on local instances. The
    Stripe CLI must be installed to run this command.

-   New model: `PricingTable`. This is a model which implements the pricing table object
    that is only available through private Stripe APIs.

## Bugfixes

-   Fix event processing sometimes crashing if an API key is not defined.
